# Tic-Tac-Toe

This task should be pretty clear, everyone knows the rules of the game. One player uses the cross, other the circle and
they take turns to mark a spot on the grid. Fist one that manages to draw a line using 3 symbols wins. Check out the HTML
and CSS of the project, you have defined classes for elements that you can use to display X and O on the grid.

If you have any questions regarding the task, or if you need help, don't hesitate to contact me.
