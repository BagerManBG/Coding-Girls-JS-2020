# Chess

This is a pretty straight forward task. You have to finish the chess project that we already started. All that's left is
to code the movements for the rest of the chess pieces and define an end of the game when someone's king is taken and also
display who the winner is and reset the game. This is not planned to be a chess game with 100% of the features, but if you
want to expand your project, you could consider some optional (generally harder) tasks:

1. Exchange the pawn if it reaches the end of the board.
1. Create a warning if your king is in danger.
1. Implement the swap between the king and rook.

If you have any questions regarding the task, or if you need help, don't hesitate to contact me.
