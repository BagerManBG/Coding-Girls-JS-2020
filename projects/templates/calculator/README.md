# Calculator

This should be a very basic calculator, which should work by pressing the buttons on it. The calculator has the four
basic math operations (+, -, *, /) and only works with whole numbers (a dot button for decimal numbers is intentionally 
omitted, because project gets too hard). The clear button should empty the result field and reset all variables.
The operations should be properly displayed on the calculator's screen together with the result after hitting enter 
(e.g. 4+5=9). Please **do NOT** use the JavaScript function **eval()**.

If you have any questions regarding the task, or if you need help, don't hesitate to contact me.
