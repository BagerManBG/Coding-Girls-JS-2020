# 8-Puzzle

This game is a 3 by 3 grid with total of 9 slots. All slots except one are filled with the numbers 1 to 8 and the last one
is an empty slot. After that all the slots are randomly shuffled (be careful with how you shuffle, because you can render
the puzzle unsolvable). The goal is for the player to put all the slots back in place. He can only move pieces into the empty
slot/space and that swaps the empty space to the selected slot's place.

Don't bother to use images (unless you want to) and do it with just the numbers.
