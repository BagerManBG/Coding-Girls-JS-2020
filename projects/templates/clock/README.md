# Clock with arrows

You have two clocks and five buttons. The left clock will show the current time and the right clock will function as a
timer. The first two buttons should start and pause the left clock. You can get the current time easily with JavaScript.
Search for a way to convert time into degrees on the arrows. To animate them change their rotation with CSS. The other three
buttons are for the timer, they start, stop and reset it.
