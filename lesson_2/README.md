# Homework #2

*Create one function for each task and test with multiple values if task allows it.*

[Task Page](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-recursion-functions-exercises.php) <br/>
1\. **(Task \#1)** Write a JavaScript program to calculate the factorial of a number. In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

2. **(Task \#8)** Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent item of an array. Sample array: **const arr1=[3, 'a', 'a', 'a', 2, 3, 'a', 3, 'a', 2, 4, 9, 3]**; Sample Output: **a ( 5 times )**

3. **(Task \#9)** Write a JavaScript program to find the armstrong numbers of 3 digits. Note: An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, **371** is an Armstrong number since **3\*\*3 + 7\*\*3 + 1\*\*3 = 371**. Search for those numbers from 100 to 999 inclusive.

4. **(Task \#10)** Write a JavaScript program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop. Output should differ depending on user input (if function is called with **5** as a parameter, do **5** lines) <br/>

Upload the solutions at your repo, it doesn't matter if you write everything in a single page or in four separate pages. Just make sure that you create one function for each task. Please don't forget to add me as a collaborator (Username: BagerManBG). If you have any questions, you can write me without
hesitation at *t.nikolov@tech-family.com*. Everything we learn can be found at [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp).

Please try to submit the homework before the next class, so we can discuss questions if there are any.
