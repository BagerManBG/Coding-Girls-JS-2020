# Homework #3

Homework is section \#8 of the HTML file. You have a red square. 
The task is to use jQuery's **animate** funciton and **setInterval** to make the square rotate in one 
direction with a constant speed (it doesn't matter how fast).
When we click on the button "Swap", the square should start rotating to the opposite direction.

In order to rotate the square, use the CSS property **transform: rotate(Xdeg);** where X is the number of degrees rotation.
So this property should be animated from 0 to 360 degrees and beyond and the other way around depending on the direction. 

If you desire a greater challenge, make it so that when you click on the square, it stops/starts rotating.
